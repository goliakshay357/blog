Right now, we have to enter the password every time we log in to the server. There's a better way to do this - authenticating via SSH keys. It's also arguably [more secure](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/69407/why-is-using-an-ssh-key-more-secure-than-using-passwords).

This involves generating the SSH keys and copying them to the `.ssh` folder in the home directory. [This manual](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-ssh-keys-on-ubuntu-20-04) describes the steps very well.

Once we're finished, the authentication happens via SSH keys and we're no longer being asked for the password.

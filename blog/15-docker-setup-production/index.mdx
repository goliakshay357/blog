Let's now use Docker in production. Before we deploy our changes, we need to install Docker on our production server. Here, we'll only install [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/) instead of *Docker Desktop*, as we don't need the GUI.

All commands in production need to be prefixed with ```sudo```. The ```build``` command has the following adjustments:
- Use port ```443``` for HTTPS.
- Our production container doesn't have access to the SSL certificate! We need to pass it a reference to the folder on our host file system that stores our SSL certificates. Docker calls these references *volumes*, hence the ```-v``` flag.

```
sudo docker run \
-d \
--name app \
--expose 443 \
-p 443:443 \
-v /etc/letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt \
-e SERVER_ENV=PROD \
app
```

Finally, we need to adjust our deploy script. It will now pull from Github, build a Docker image, stop the currently running container, start a container from the fresh image, and prune the old image.

```
msg "Pulling from GitHub"
git pull

msg "Building Docker image"
sudo docker build --tag app .

msg "Stopping Docker container"
sudo docker stop app
sudo docker rm app

msg "Starting Docker container"
sudo docker run \
-d \
--name app \
--expose 443 \
-p 443:443 \
-v /etc/letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt \
-e SERVER_ENV=PROD \
app

msg "Pruning stale Docker images"
sudo docker image prune -f
```

We have just deployed our first container! We now have a nicely isolated web server application that we can deploy locally and in production. At first glance, our changes have not achieved much - we still have a simple app we deploy with a single command. But this setup will start paying big dividends once the complexity of our app increases. In the next post, we will set up a container with SQL database.

Let's make our server aware of its environment. On our local machine, we want to listen on our local port `8080`. On the production server, we want to use HTTPS and port `443`.

We need to use environment variables to set this context. These variables are loaded whenever a shell is started. On macOS, I added the following line to my `.zprofile` script. This is a script that runs whenever `zshell` (which is what I use) opens. If you use the regular bash, you want to edit `.bash_profile`.

```
nano .zprofile
...
export SERVER_ENV="DEV"
```

On our production server, we need to make the variable visible to the root. Remember - we are running our server with `sudo`. The file we need to edit is `/etc/environment`. We can omit the `export` bit.

```
sudo nano /etc/environment
...
SERVER_ENV="PROD"
```

We need to log out and back in for our changes to take effect. But before that, let's adjust our server code. We can access the environment variable with the `os.Getenv()` method. In the code, I added a simple if statement - if the variable is `DEV`, let's run a local server with HTTP. If it's `PROD`, let's listen on a different port with HTTPS.

The adjusted `main()` function is below.

```go
func main() {
	http.HandleFunc("/data", getData);

	serverEnv := os.Getenv("SERVER_ENV")

	if serverEnv == "DEV" {
		http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
	} else if serverEnv == "PROD" {
		http.ListenAndServeTLS(
			":443",
			"/etc/letsencrypt/live/api.jurajmajerik.com/fullchain.pem",
			"/etc/letsencrypt/live/api.jurajmajerik.com/privkey.pem",
			nil,
		)
	}
}
```

We can now test our code. Run it locally, then deploy with `scp` and test on the production server. Both local and production endpoint should now return `Hello world`.

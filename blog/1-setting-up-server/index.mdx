Let's set up a server on Digital Ocean. For now, the cheapest option with 1 GiB memory and 25 GiB disk will be more than enough. After setting it up with a fresh installation of Ubuntu 20.04, we can preview our server in the Digital Ocean dashboard.

The important part is the `IPv4` address. We can access our server at this address, via the `ssh` command. Out of the box, the Ubuntu server on the Digital Ocean only has the `root` user. We need to prefix the user name before the address bit.

```
ssh root@178.62.242.234
```

Once we type in the password, we're inside of our server.

```
âžœ  ~ ssh root@178.62.242.234
root@178.62.242.234's password:
Welcome to Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS (GNU/Linux 5.4.0-110-generic x86_64)
...
```
